# haskell
These are some Haskell functions that I have written

The functions in math-functions.hs and list-functions.hs almost exclusively repeat what is natively available in Haskell. The main reason for these is to show how these operations can be done from first principles, with no built in functions (almost). 

 ### Math Functions
  - increment
  - decrement
  - add
  - multiply
  - raise to the power (exponent)
  
 ### List Functions
 - length
 - contains
 - largest
 - zipped
 - insert
 - sort (insertion sort)
